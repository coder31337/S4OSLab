P4 Round Robin Scheduling

Step 1: START
Step 2: Read the number of processes.
Step 3: Read the burst time of each process.
Step 4: Read the value of time slice.
Step 5: For all processes,
            If remaining burst time of a process is greater than time slice,
                Add time slice to current time.
                Subtract time slice from remaining burst time.
            Else
                Add remaining burst time to current time.
                Set remaining burst time to 0.
        Repeat till remaining burst time of all processes is 0.
Step 6: Calculate turnaround time of each process as;
        turnaround time = burst time + waiting time
Step 7: Calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time
        of all processes.
Step 8: Print the calculated values.
Step 9: Print the average waiting time and average turnaround time.
Step 10: STOP
