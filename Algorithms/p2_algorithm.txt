P2 SJF Scheduling

Step 1: START
Step 2: Read the number of processes.
Step 3: Read the burst time of each process.
Step 4: Sort the processes in ascending order of their burst times.
Step 5: Calculate turnaround time of each process as;
        turnaround time = turnaround time of previous process
                          + burst time of current process
Step 7: Calculate waiting time of each process as;
        waiting time = turnaround time - burst time
Step 8: Calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time
        of all processes.
Step 9: Print the order of execution with the calculated values.
Step 10: Print the average waiting time and average turnaround time.
Step 11: STOP
